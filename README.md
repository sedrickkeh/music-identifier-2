# Classical Music Identifier
We have flashcards for studying all sorts of things, but why don't we have flashcards for listening to music? Well, now we do! (sort of)

This is a simple, no-frills quiz game for identifying classical music. MIDI files are taken from [GiantMIDI-Piano](https://github.com/bytedance/GiantMIDI-Piano), although I did filter for some of the more well-known composers (otherwise the file would be too large).


## Quick Setup

First install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the game, call 
```bash
python main.py
```
